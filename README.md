An AI-powered intelligent browser built with Next.js and Electron. Features multi-modal AI task execution, scheduled tasks, social media integration, and advanced file management capabilities with support for multiple AI providers.

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org).

> **⚠️ Important Notes**
>
> - This project is for **learning purposes**. There may be bugs and issues - your understanding is appreciated.
> - **Windows users**: Building on Windows may require multiple attempts to succeed. If the build fails, try running the build command again.
> - **macOS recommended**: The macOS version provides a better user experience. Limited resources have been allocated to Windows optimization.
> - **AI Provider note**: Due to limited resources and network restrictions (no access to Claude, OpenAI, etc.), this project is primarily developed and tested with **DeepSeek** models. Other providers are supported but may have less thorough testing coverage. Community contributions for other providers are welcome!
